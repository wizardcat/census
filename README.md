# The 0.0.5 version.

The purpose of this project is to present in a convenient form some results of the first general census conducted in the Russian Empire in 1897.
It will present the distribution of the population by native language in the provinces of the empire. I find this information very interesting, especially in light of the myth spread by Russia about the non-existent Ukrainian language. :)
